        <p>Nebraska Writing Project’s premiere program, the Summer Institute is open to teachers of all disciplines and grade levels. The 2023 Summer Institute redesigns the National Writing Project model as an hybrid experience to allow both in-person and distance access. Participants will generate writing, share best teaching practices for writing at their grade level and disciplines, and engage in inquiry and research into aspects of writing. Participants may also qualify for monetary stipends of between $300 and $500 to help offset the cost of 6 graduate credit hours (approximately $2000) in English or Teaching, Learning, and Teacher Education.</p>

      <p>At a time when teacher morale is plummeting, and burnout is peaking, we need collective teacher-centered explorations into what practices and institutional changes will sustain and re-moralize (Santoro) educators. In this Advanced Institute, we’ll come together to write, discuss, read, and listen to local mindfulness and trauma experts, about how mindfulness, community care, and critical inquiry might help us move forward from the collective trauma of the pandemic--and all the pressure teachers bore as a result. We will ask: What practices might best sustain us as individuals and as educators? How can we be teacher-leaders in our schools, who support other educators and our students through this difficult time? How can we come together to ask for resources and support from administrators and policy makers? Together, we will work toward solutions of restoration and rebuilding--of ourselves and our educational cultures.</p>
